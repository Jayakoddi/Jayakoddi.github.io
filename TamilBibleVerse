      As I look back at what was and look ahead at what will be, I know You are a refuge and safe place to process my feelings. 
      Thank You for being so close to me during this time. I am looking to You and believing that today I can take some steps forward and whisper “God be with you” to those who have left wounds in my heart. This isn’t me saying I’m OK with what they did — I know You will eventually hold them accountable for their sin. But it is me saying I want to fully live again. 
      You can bring eventual good in all things, and today I trust that You absolutely will. In Jesus’ Name, Amen." ,
